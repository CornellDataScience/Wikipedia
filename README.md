**Objective: **To model  the structure of knowledge on Wikipedia and provide recommendations for a path of learning based on a certain inputted topic. 

When learning a new topic, there are two particular challenges one can face: 

 	1. Upstream knowledge: The user wants to learn a new topic, but doesn't know where to start. For example, a user might want to know how Principal Component Analysis (PCA) works, but they don't know what topics are prerequisite to their understanding. 
		2. Downstream knowledge: The user knows the basics of a topic, but wants to learn more. For example, a student has finished their first Linear Algebra course and they want to discover ways they can apply their knowledge. 

We aim to solve both these problems and provide a customized path of learning for any user by analyzing the network and similarities of Wikipedia articles and generating a new graph-based visualization.
