            "text": "In December, Beyonc\u00e9 along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for \"Demand A Plan\", a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 US mayors and others[432] designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[433] Beyonc\u00e9 became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song \"I Was Here\" and its music video, shot in the UN, to the campaign.[434][435] In 2013, it was announced that Beyonc\u00e9 would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music.[436] A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013 in London[437] and included other acts like Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, and Rita Ora.[438] In advance of the concert, she appeared in a campaign video released on May 15, 2013, where she, along with Cameron Diaz, John Legend and Kylie Minogue, described inspiration from their mothers, while a number of other artists celebrated personal inspiration from other women, leading to a call for submission of photos of women of viewers' inspiration from which a selection was shown at the concert. Beyonc\u00e9 said about her mother Tina Knowles that her gift was \"finding the best qualities in every human being.\" With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls.[439][440] Beyonc\u00e9 is also taking part in \"Miss a Meal\", a food-donation campaign,[441] and supporting Goodwill charity through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S.[442][443] In December 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 was named the Most Charitable Celebrity of the year.[444]Beyonc\u00e9 participated in George Clooney and Wyclef Jean's Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief telethon[426] and was named the official face of the limited edition CFDA \"Fashion For Haiti\" T-shirt,[427] made by Theory which raised a total of $1\u00a0million.[428] On March 5, 2010, Beyonc\u00e9 and her mother Tina opened the Beyonc\u00e9 Cosmetology Center at the Brooklyn Phoenix House, offering a seven-month cosmetology training course for men and women. In April 2011, Beyonc\u00e9 joined forces with US First Lady Michelle Obama and the National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation, to help boost the latter's campaign against child obesity[429] by reworking her single \"Get Me Bodied\".[430] Following the death of Osama bin Laden, Beyonc\u00e9 released her cover of the Lee Greenwood song \"God Bless the USA\", as a charity single to help raise funds for the New York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund.[431]After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rowland founded the Survivor Foundation to provide transitional housing for victims in the Houston area,[13] to which Beyonc\u00e9 contributed an initial $250,000.[423] The foundation has since expanded to work with other charities in the city,[424] and also provided relief following Hurricane Ike three years later.[425]In October 2014, Beyonc\u00e9 signed a deal to launch an activewear line of clothing with British fashion retailer Topshop.[420][421] The 50\u201350 venture is called Ivy Park and was launched in April 2016. The brand's name is a nod to Beyonc\u00e9's daughter Blue Ivy and her favourite number four (IV in roman numerals), and also references the park where she used to run in Texas.[422]In 2005, Beyonc\u00e9 teamed up with House of Brands, a shoe company, to produce a range of footwear for House of Der\u00e9on.[417] In January 2008, Starwave Mobile launched Beyonc\u00e9 Fashion Diva, a \"high-style\" mobile game with a social networking component, featuring the House of Der\u00e9on collection.[412] In July 2009, Beyonc\u00e9 and her mother launched a new junior apparel label, Sasha Fierce for Der\u00e9on, for back-to-school selling.

Beyonc\u00e9 and her mother founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Der\u00e9on, and its junior collection, Der\u00e9on.[412] House of Der\u00e9on pieces were exhibited in Destiny's Child's shows and tours, during their Destiny Fulfilled era.[415][416] The collection features sportswear, denim offerings with fur, outerwear and accessories that include handbags and footwear, and are available at department and specialty stores across the US and Canada.[412]In March 2015, Beyonc\u00e9 became a co-owner, with other artists, of the music streaming service Tidal. The service specializes in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Beyonc\u00e9's husband Jay-Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015.[409] Including Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake.[410] The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.[411]The release of a video-game Starpower: Beyonc\u00e9 was cancelled after Beyonc\u00e9 pulled out of a $100\u00a0million with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development.[405] It was settled out of court by her lawyers in June 2013 who said that they had cancelled because GateFive had lost its financial backers.[406] Beyonc\u00e9 also has had deals with American Express,[308] Nintendo DS[407] and L'Or\u00e9al since the age of 18.[408]Beyonc\u00e9 has worked with Tommy Hilfiger for the fragrances True Star (singing a cover version of \"Wishing on a Star\")[396] and True Star Gold;[397] she also promoted Emporio Armani's Diamonds fragrance in 2007.[398] Beyonc\u00e9 launched her first official fragrance, Heat, in 2010.[399] The commercial, which featured the 1956 song \"Fever\", was shown after the water shed in the United Kingdom as it begins with an image of Beyonc\u00e9 appearing to lie naked in a room.[400] In February 2011, Beyonc\u00e9 launched her second fragrance, Heat Rush.[401] Beyonc\u00e9's third fragrance, Pulse, was launched in September 2011.[402] In 2013, The Mrs. Carter Show Limited Edition version of Heat was released.[403] The six editions of Heat are the world's best-selling celebrity fragrance line,[403] with sales of over $400\u00a0million.[404]Beyonc\u00e9 has worked with Pepsi since 2002,[391] and in 2004 appeared in a Gladiator-themed commercial with Britney Spears, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[392] In 2012, Beyonc\u00e9 signed a $50\u00a0million deal to endorse Pepsi.[393] The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPINET) wrote Beyonc\u00e9 an open letter asking her to reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of the product and to donate the proceeds to a medical organisation.[394] Nevertheless, NetBase found that Beyonc\u00e9's campaign was the most talked about endorsement in April 2013, with a 70 per cent positive audience response to the commercial and print ads.[395]She was named on the 2016 BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour Power List as one of seven women judged to have had the biggest impact on women's lives over the past 70 years, alongside Margaret Thatcher, Barbara Castle, Helen Brook, Germaine Greer, Jayaben Desai and Bridget Jones.[390]Following her role in Dreamgirls Beyonc\u00e9 was nominated for Best Original Song for \"Listen\" and Best Actress at the Golden Globe Awards,[385] and Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture at the NAACP Image Awards.[386] Beyonc\u00e9 won two awards at the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards 2006; Best Song for \"Listen\" and Best Original Soundtrack for Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture.[387] According to Fuse in 2014, Beyonc\u00e9 is the second most award-winning artist of all time, after Michael Jackson.[388][389]Beyonc\u00e9 has also won 24 MTV Video Music Awards, making her the most-awarded artist in Video Music Award history. \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and \"Formation\" won Video of the Year in 2009 and 2016 respectively. Beyonc\u00e9 tied the record set by Lady Gaga in 2010 for the most VMAs won in one night for a female artist with eight in 2016.[177] She is also the most awarded and nominated artist in BET Award history, winning 24 awards from a total of 54 nominations.[384]Beyonc\u00e9 has won 22 Grammy Awards, both as a solo artist and member of Destiny's Child, making her the second most honored female artist by the Grammys, behind Alison Krauss[380][381] and the most nominated woman in Grammy Award history with a total of 62 nominations.[382] \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" won Song of the Year in 2010 while \"Say My Name\",[23] \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Drunk in Love\" have each won Best R&B Song. Dangerously in Love, B'Day and I Am... Sasha Fierce have all won Best Contemporary R&B Album, while Lemonade has won Best Urban Contemporary Album. Beyonc\u00e9 set the record for the most Grammy awards won by a female artist in one night in 2010 when she won six awards, breaking the tie she previously held with Alicia Keys, Norah Jones, Alison Krauss, and Amy Winehouse, with Adele equaling this in 2012.[383]Beyonc\u00e9 has received numerous awards. As a solo artist she has sold over 17\u00a0million albums in the US, and over 100\u00a0million records worldwide (a further 60\u00a0million additionally with Destiny's Child), making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[366][367][368][369][370][371] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) listed Beyonc\u00e9 as the top certified artist of the 2000s decade, with a total of 64 certifications.[372][373] Her songs \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", \"Halo\", and \"Irreplaceable\" are some of the best-selling singles of all time worldwide. In 2009, The Observer named her the Artist of the Decade[326] and Billboard named her the Top Female Artist and Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade.[6][374][375] In 2010, Billboard named her in their \"Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years\" list at number 15.[376] In 2012 VH1 ranked her third on their list of the \"100 Greatest Women in Music\", behind Mariah Carey and Madonna.[377] Beyonc\u00e9 was honored with the International Artist Award at the 2007 American Music Awards.[378] She has also received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards, the Billboard Millennium Award at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, and the Fashion Icon Award at the 2016 CFDA Awards.[379]Her debut single, \"Crazy in Love\" was named VH1's \"Greatest Song of the 2000s\",[355] NME's \"Best Track of the 00s\"[356] and \"Pop Song of the Century\",[357] considered by Rolling Stone to be one of the 500 greatest songs of all time, earned two Grammy Awards and is one of the best-selling singles of all time at around 8\u00a0million copies. The music video for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", which achieved fame for its intricate choreography[358] and its deployment of jazz hands,[359] was credited by the Toronto Star as having started the \"first major dance craze of both the new millennium and the Internet\",[93] triggering a number of parodies of the dance choreography[360][361] and a legion of amateur imitators on YouTube.[358][360] In 2013, Drake released a single titled \"Girls Love Beyonc\u00e9\", which featured an interpolation from Destiny Child's \"Say My Name\" and discussed his relationship with women.[362] In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse fly found in Northern Queensland, Australia after Beyonc\u00e9 due to the fly's unique golden hairs on its abdomen.[363] In July 2014, a Beyonc\u00e9 exhibit was introduced into the \"Legends of Rock\" section of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The black leotard from the \"Single Ladies\" video and her outfit from the Super Bowl half time performance are among several pieces housed at the museum.[364] Architects credit Beyonc\u00e9's look in her \"Ghost\" music video as the inspiration of the design of the Premier Tower under construction in Australia.[365]Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork noticed her contribution in changing the sound of pop music radio with her hip-hop assisted style, writing:Beyonc\u00e9's work has influenced numerous artists including Britney Spears,[329] Adele,[330] Ariana Grande,[331][332] Lady Gaga,[333] Ellie Goulding,[334] Rihanna,[335] Kelly Rowland,[336][337] Sam Smith,[338] Nicole Scherzinger,[339] Jessica Sanchez,[340] Cheryl,[341] JoJo,[342] Meghan Trainor,[343] Grimes,[344][345] Rita Ora,[346] Zendaya,[347] Alexis Jordan,[348] Bridgit Mendler,[349] and Azealia Banks.[350] American indie rock band White Rabbits also cited her an inspiration for their third album Milk Famous (2012),[351] friend Gwyneth Paltrow[352] studied Beyonc\u00e9 at her live concerts while learning to become a musical performer for the 2010 film Country Strong.[353]In 2014, Beyonc\u00e9 was listed again on the Time 100 and also featured on the cover of the issue.[328]In 2013, Beyonc\u00e9 made the Time 100 list, with Baz Luhrmann writing:In The New Yorker, music critic Jody Rosen described Beyonc\u00e9 as \"the most important and compelling popular musician of the twenty-first century..... the result, the logical end point, of a century-plus of pop.\"[325] When The Observer named her Artist of the Decade, Llewyn-Smith wrote:MTV estimated that by the end of 2014, Beyonc\u00e9 would become the highest-paid black musician in history;[318] this became the case in April 2014.[319] In June 2014, Beyonc\u00e9 ranked at number one on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115\u00a0million throughout June 2013 \u2013 June 2014. This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date.[320] In 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 ranked at number 34 on the Celebrity 100 list with earnings of $54 million. Herself and Jay-Z also topped the highest paid celebrity couple list, with combined earnings of $107.5 million.[321] As of May 2017, Forbes calculated her net worth to be $350 million, and in June of the same year, ranked her as the second-highest earning celebrity with annual earnings of $105 million. This tied Beyonc\u00e9 with Madonna as the only two female artists to earn more than $100 million within a single year twice.[1][322] As a couple with Jay-Z, they have a combined net worth of $1.16 billion.[323] In July 2017, Billboard announced that Beyonc\u00e9 was the highest paid musician of 2016, with an estimated total of $62.1 million.[324]Forbes magazine began reporting on Beyonc\u00e9's earnings in 2008, calculating that the $80\u00a0million earned between June 2007 to June 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the world's best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion.[307][308] They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009[309] and ninth on the \"Most Powerful Women in the World\" list in 2010.[310] The following year, Forbes placed her eighth on the \"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\" list, having earned $35\u00a0million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyonc\u00e9 at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40\u00a0million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals.[311][312] In the same year, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z placed at number one on the \"World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples\", for collectively earning $78\u00a0million.[313] The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness World Records as the \"highest-earning power couple\" for collectively earning $122 million in 2009.[314] For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyonc\u00e9 earned an average of $70\u00a0million per year, and earned $40\u00a0million in 2012.[315] In 2013, Beyonc\u00e9's endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay-Z the world's first billion dollar couple in the music industry.[316] That year, Beyonc\u00e9 was published as the fourth most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings.[317]In February 2017, Beyonc\u00e9 spoke out against the withdrawal of protections for transgender students in public schools by Donald Trump's Presidential administration. Posting a link to the 100 Days of Kindness campaign on her Facebook page, Beyonc\u00e9 voiced her support for transgender youth and joined a roster of celebrities who spoke out against Trump's decision.[306]Beyonc\u00e9 publicly endorsed same sex marriage on March 26, 2013, after the Supreme Court debate on California's Proposition 8.[301] Beyonc\u00e9 spoke against North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, a bill passed (and later repealed) that discriminated against the LGBT community in public places in a statement during her concert in Raleigh as part of the Formation World Tour in 2016.[302] She has also condemned police brutality against black Americans. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z attended a rally in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting of Trayvon Martin.[303] The film for her sixth album Lemonade included the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their sons in the video for \"Freedom\".[304] In a 2016 interview with Elle, Beyonc\u00e9 responded to the controversy surrounding her song \"Formation\" which was perceived to be critical of the police. She clarified, \"I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things. If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me\".[305]In 2013, Beyonc\u00e9 stated in an interview with Vogue that she considered herself to be \"a modern-day feminist\".[296] She would later align herself more publicly with the movement, sampling \"We should all be feminists\", a speech delivered by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a TEDx talk in April 2013, in her song \"Flawless\", released later that year.[297] In 2014 she performed live at the MTV Video Awards in front a giant backdrop reading \"FEMINIST.\"[298] She has also contributed to the Ban Bossy campaign, which uses television and social media to encourage leadership in girls.[299] Following Beyonc\u00e9's public identification as a feminist, the sexualized nature of her performances and the fact that she championed her marriage was questioned.[300]Beyonc\u00e9 performed \"America the Beautiful\" at the 2009 presidential inauguration, as well as \"At Last\" during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later.[290] They held a fundraiser at Jay-Z's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for Obama's 2012 presidential campaign[291] which raised $4\u00a0million.[292] In the 2012 Presidential election, Beyonc\u00e9 voted for Obama.[293] She performed the American national anthem at his second inauguration in January 2013.[133] The Washington Post reported in May 2015, that Beyonc\u00e9 attended a major celebrity fundraiser for 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.[294] She also headlined for Hillary Clinton in a 2016 concert held the weekend before Election Day. In this performance, Beyonc\u00e9 and her entourage of backup dancers wore pantsuits; a clear allusion to Clinton's frequent dress-of-choice. The backup dancers also wore\u00a0\"I'm with her\"\u00a0tee shirts, the campaign slogan for Clinton. In a brief speech at this performance Beyonc\u00e9 said, \"I want my daughter to grow up seeing a women lead our country and knowing that her possibilities are limitless.\"[295]On February 1, 2017 she revealed on her Instagram account that she was expecting twins. Her announcement gained 6,335,571 \"likes\" within eight hours, breaking the world record for the most liked image on the website at the time.[288] On July 13, 2017, Beyonc\u00e9 uploaded the first image of herself and the twins onto her Instagram account, confirming their birth date as a month prior, on June 13, 2017 and the names Rumi and Sir Carter.[289] The twins were born at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in California. Rumi, the daughter, was born before Sir, the son.Beyonc\u00e9 suffered a miscarriage around 2010 or 2011, describing it as \"the saddest thing\" she had ever endured.[280] She returned to the studio and wrote music in order to cope with the loss. In April 2011, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z traveled to Paris in order to shoot the album cover for 4, and unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris.[281] In August, the couple attended the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, at which Beyonc\u00e9 performed \"Love on Top\" and ended the performance by revealing she was pregnant.[282] Her appearance helped that year's MTV Video Music Awards become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in 12.4\u00a0million viewers;[283] the announcement was listed in Guinness World Records for \"most tweets per second recorded for a single event\" on Twitter,[284] receiving 8,868 tweets per second[285] and \"Beyonce pregnant\" was the most Googled term the week of August 29, 2011.[286] On January 7, 2012, Beyonc\u00e9 gave birth to a daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.[287]Beyonc\u00e9 started a relationship with Jay-Z after their collaboration on \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\",[276] which appeared on his seventh album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002).[277] Beyonc\u00e9 appeared as Jay-Z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, fuelling speculation about their relationship.[278] On April 4, 2008, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z married without publicity.[83] As of April 2014, the couple had sold a combined 300 million records together.[151] They are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed in recent years.[279]Beyonc\u00e9's lighter skin color and costuming has drawn criticism from some in the African-American community.[272] Emmett Price, a professor of music at Northeastern University, wrote in 2007, that he thinks race plays a role in many of these criticisms, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments.[272] In 2008, L'Or\u00e9al was accused of whitening her skin in their Feria hair color advertisements, responding that \"it is categorically untrue\",[273][274] and in 2013, Beyonc\u00e9 herself criticized H&M for their proposed \"retouching\" of promotional images of her, and according to Vogue requested that only \"natural pictures be used\".[275]In 2006, the animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), criticized Beyonc\u00e9 for wearing and using fur in her clothing line House of Der\u00e9on.[270] In 2011, she appeared on the cover of French fashion magazine L'Officiel, in blackface and tribal makeup that drew criticism from the media. A statement released from a spokesperson for the magazine said that Beyonc\u00e9's look was \"far from the glamorous Sasha Fierce\" and that it was \"a return to her African roots\".[271]The BeyHive is the name given to Beyonc\u00e9's fan base. Fans were previously titled \"The Beyontourage\", (a portmanteau of Beyonc\u00e9 and entourage). The name Bey Hive derives from the word beehive, purposely misspelled to resemble her first name, and was penned by fans after petitions on the online social networking service Twitter and online news reports during competitions.[269]According to Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli, Beyonc\u00e9 uses different fashion styles to work with her music while performing.[263] Her mother co-wrote a book, published in 2002, titled Destiny's Style[264] an account of how fashion affected the trio's success.[265] The B'Day Anthology Video Album showed many instances of fashion-oriented footage, depicting classic to contemporary wardrobe styles.[266] In 2007, Beyonc\u00e9 was featured on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, becoming the second African American woman after Tyra Banks,[267] and People magazine recognized Beyonc\u00e9 as the best-dressed celebrity.[268]In September 2010, Beyonc\u00e9 made her runway modelling debut at Tom Ford's Spring/Summer 2011 fashion show.[251] She was named \"World's Most Beautiful Woman\" by People[252] and the \"Hottest Female Singer of All Time\" by Complex in 2012.[253] In January 2013, GQ placed her on its cover, featuring her atop its \"100 Sexiest Women of the 21st Century\" list.[254][255] VH1 listed her at number 1 on its 100 Sexiest Artists list.[256] Several wax figures of Beyonc\u00e9 are found at Madame Tussauds Wax Museums in major cities around the world, including New York,[257] Washington, D.C.,[258] Amsterdam,[259] Bangkok,[260] Hollywood[261] and Sydney.[262]Beyonc\u00e9 has been described as having a wide-ranging sex appeal, with music journalist Tour\u00e9 writing that since the release of Dangerously in Love, she has \"become a crossover sex symbol\".[246] Offstage Beyonc\u00e9 says that while she likes to dress sexily, her onstage dress \"is absolutely for the stage.\"[247] Due to her curves and the term's catchiness, in the 2000s (decade), the media often used the term \"Bootylicious\" (a portmanteau of the words booty and delicious) to describe Beyonc\u00e9,[248][249] the term popularized by Destiny's Child's single of the same name. In 2006, it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.[250]Described as being \"sexy, seductive and provocative\" when performing on stage, Beyonc\u00e9 has said that she originally created the alter ego \"Sasha Fierce\" to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is. She described Sasha as being \"too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy\", stating, \"I'm not like her in real life at all.\"[32] Sasha was conceived during the making of \"Crazy in Love\", and Beyonc\u00e9 introduced her with the release of her 2008 album I Am... Sasha Fierce. In February 2010, she announced in an interview with Allure magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need Sasha Fierce.[244] However, Beyonc\u00e9 announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live shows later that month.[245]Beyonc\u00e9 has worked with numerous directors for her music videos throughout her career, including Melina Matsoukas, Jonas \u00c5kerlund, and Jake Nava. Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the Lemonade visuals in particular served as inspiration for his film, commenting \"You look at Beyonce\u2019s brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms\u2026 I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want.\"[243]Beyonc\u00e9 has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post placed her at number one on her list of the Five Best Singer/Dancers.[236] According to Barbara Ellen of The Guardian Beyonc\u00e9 is the most in-charge female artist she's seen onstage,[237] while Alice Jones of The Independent wrote she \"takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good.\"[238] The ex-President of Def Jam L.A. Reid has described Beyonc\u00e9 as the greatest entertainer alive.[239] Jim Farber of the Daily News and Stephanie Classen of The StarPhoenix both praised her strong voice and her stage presence.[240][241] Beyonc\u00e9's stage outfits have been met with criticism from many countries, such as Malaysia, where she has postponed or cancelled performances due to the country's strict laws banning revealing costumes.[242]In 2006, Beyonc\u00e9 introduced her all-female tour band Suga Mama (also the name of a song in B'Day) which includes bassists, drummers, guitarists, horn players, keyboardists and percussionists.[235] Her background singers, The Mamas, consist of Montina Cooper-Donnell, Crystal Collins and Tiffany Moniqu\u00e9 Riddick. They made their debut appearance at the 2006 BET Awards and re-appeared in the music videos for \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Green Light\".[206] The band have supported Beyonc\u00e9 in most subsequent live performances, including her 2007 concert tour The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience, 2009\u20132010 I Am... World Tour, 2013\u20132014 The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and 2016 The Formation World Tour.Beyonc\u00e9 has stated that she is personally inspired by Michelle Obama (the 44th First Lady of the United States), saying \"She proves you can do it all\"[230] and she has described Oprah Winfrey as \"the definition of inspiration and a strong woman\".[216] She has also discussed how Jay-Z is a continuing inspiration to her, both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life.[231] Beyonc\u00e9 has expressed admiration for the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, posting in a letter \"what I find in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, I search for in every day in music... he is lyrical and raw\".[232][233] In February 2013, Beyonc\u00e9 said that Madonna inspired her to take control of her own career. She commented, \"I think about Madonna and how she took all of the great things she achieved and started the label and developed other artists. But there are not enough of those women.\".[234]The feminism and female empowerment themes on Beyonc\u00e9's second solo album B'Day were inspired by her role in Dreamgirls[226] and by singer Josephine Baker.[227] Beyonc\u00e9 paid homage to Baker by performing \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" at the 2006 Fashion Rocks concert wearing Baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas.[228] Beyonc\u00e9's third solo album I Am... Sasha Fierce was inspired by Jay-Z and especially by Etta James, whose \"boldness\" inspired Beyonc\u00e9 to explore other musical genres and styles.[229] Her fourth solo album, 4, was inspired by Fela Kuti, 1990s R&B, Earth, Wind & Fire, DeBarge, Lionel Richie, Teena Marie, The Jackson 5, New Edition, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Prince.[199]Beyonc\u00e9 names Michael Jackson as her major musical influence.[213] Aged five, Beyonc\u00e9 attended her first ever concert where Jackson performed and she claims to have realized her purpose.[214] When she presented him with a tribute award at the World Music Awards in 2006, Beyonc\u00e9 said, \"if it wasn't for Michael Jackson, I would never ever have performed.\"[215] She admires Diana Ross as an \"all-around entertainer\"[216] and Whitney Houston, who she said \"inspired me to get up there and do what she did.\"[217] She credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song \"Vision of Love\" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child.[218][219] Her other musical influences include Aaliyah,[220] Prince,[221] Lauryn Hill,[216] Sade Adu,[222] Donna Summer,[223] Mary J. Blige,[224] Janet Jackson,[225] Anita Baker and Rachelle Ferrell.[216]In 2001, she became the first black woman and second female lyricist to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Pop Music Awards.[13][209] Beyonc\u00e9 was the third woman to have writing credits on three number one songs (\"Irreplaceable\", \"Grillz\" and \"Check on It\") in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American lyricist Diane Warren at third with nine song-writing credits on number-one singles.[210] (The latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song \"I Was Here\" for 4.[211]) In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Beyonc\u00e9 at number 17 on their list of the \"Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters\", for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of only three women on that list, along with Alicia Keys and Taylor Swift.[212]She has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with Destiny's Child and her solo efforts.[23] Her early songs were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like \"Independent Women\" and \"Survivor\", but after the start of her relationship with Jay-Z, she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as \"Cater 2 U\".[207] Beyonc\u00e9 has also received co-producing credits for most of the records in which she has been involved, especially during her solo efforts. However, she does not formulate beats herself, but typically comes up with melodies and ideas during production, sharing them with producers.[208]Beyonc\u00e9's music is generally R&B,[204] but she also incorporates pop,[205] soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyonc\u00e9's exploration of 1990s-style R&B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases.[199] While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyonc\u00e9 recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyonc\u00e9 was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.[206]Jody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as \"one of the most compelling instruments in popular music\".[200] Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child.[201] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\".[202] Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyonc\u00e9's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto.[200] Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.\"[203]On April 14, 2018, Beyonc\u00e9 played the first of two weekends as the headlining act of the Coachella Music Festival. Her April 14 performance, attended by 125,000 festival-goers, was immediately praised, with multiple media outlets describing it as historic.

However, this was put on hold so she could concentrate on recording Destiny Fulfilled, the final studio album by Destiny's Child.[56] Released on November 15, 2004, in the US[57] and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200,[58][59] Destiny Fulfilled included the singles \"Lose My Breath\" and \"Soldier\", which reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[60] Destiny's Child embarked on a worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It and during the last stop of their European tour, in Barcelona on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced that Destiny's Child would disband following the North American leg of the tour.[61] The group released their first compilation album Number\u00a01's on October 25, 2005, in the US[62] and accepted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in March 2006.[63] The group has sold 60 million records worldwide.[64][65]Beyonc\u00e9's first solo recording was a feature on Jay-Z's \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" that was released in October 2002, peaking at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.[47] Her first solo album Dangerously in Love was released on June 24, 2003, after Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland had released their solo efforts.[48] The album sold 317,000 copies in its first week, debuted atop the Billboard 200,[49] and has since sold 11 million copies worldwide.[50] The album's lead single, \"Crazy in Love\", featuring Jay-Z, became Beyonc\u00e9's first number-one single as a solo artist in the US.[51] The single \"Baby Boy\" also reached number one,[46] and singles, \"Me, Myself and I\" and \"Naughty Girl\", both reached the top-five.[52] The album earned Beyonc\u00e9 a then record-tying five awards at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards; Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \"Dangerously in Love 2\", Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Crazy in Love\", and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for \"The Closer I Get to You\" with Luther Vandross.[53]In July 2002, Beyonc\u00e9 continued her acting career playing Foxxy Cleopatra alongside Mike Myers in the comedy film Austin Powers in Goldmember,[38] which spent its first weekend atop the US box office and grossed $73\u00a0million.[39] Beyonc\u00e9 released \"Work It Out\" as the lead single from its soundtrack album which entered the top ten in the UK, Norway, and Belgium.[40] In 2003, Beyonc\u00e9 starred opposite Cuba Gooding, Jr., in the musical comedy The Fighting Temptations as Lilly, a single mother with whom Gooding's character falls in love.[41] The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $30\u00a0million in the U.S.[42][43] Beyonc\u00e9 released \"Fighting Temptation\" as the lead single from the film's soundtrack album, with Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Free which was also used to promote the film.[44] Another of Beyonc\u00e9's contributions to the soundtrack, \"Summertime\", fared better on the US charts.[45]The remaining band members recorded \"Independent Women Part I\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film Charlie's Angels.

Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th-century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet.[35] When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them.[23] The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.[36] The album spawned other number-one hits, \"Bootylicious\" and the title track, \"Survivor\", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.[37] After releasing their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.[23]LeToya Luckett and Roberson became unhappy with Mathew's managing of the band and eventually were replaced by Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams.[23] Beyonc\u00e9 experienced depression following the split with Luckett and Roberson after being publicly blamed by the media, critics, and blogs for its cause.[30] Her long-standing boyfriend left her at this time.[31] The depression was so severe it lasted for a couple of years, during which she occasionally kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything.[32] Beyonc\u00e9 stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first Grammy Award, and she feared no one would take her seriously.[33] Beyonc\u00e9 would later speak of her mother as the person who helped her fight it.[32] Franklin was then dismissed, leaving just Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Williams.[34]The group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.[28] In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song \"Killing Time\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black.[26] The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album,[25] scoring their first major hit \"No, No, No\".

The group released their Multi-Platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", the group's first number-one single, \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\" and \"Say My Name\", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. \"Say My Name\" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[23] The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide.[25] During this time, Beyonc\u00e9 recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song \"After All Is Said and Done\" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man.[29]When Beyonc\u00e9 was eight, she and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.[23] They were placed into a group called Girl's Tyme with three other girls, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston.[24] After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyonc\u00e9 later said the song they performed was not good.[25][26] In 1995 Beyonc\u00e9's father resigned from his job to manage the group.[27] The move reduced Beyonc\u00e9's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments.[13] Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups.[23] The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company.[13] This put further strain on the family, and Beyonc\u00e9's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.[17]Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles was born in Houston, Texas, to Celestine \"Tina\" Knowles (n\u00e9e Beyinc\u00e9), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager.[12] Beyonc\u00e9's name is a tribute to her mother's maiden name.[13] Beyonc\u00e9's younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former backup dancer for Destiny's Child.

Beyonc\u00e9 also continued her acting career, with starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006), Dreamgirls (2006), and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay-Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which saw the introduction of her alter-ego Sasha Fierce and earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010, including Song of the Year for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". Beyonc\u00e9 took a hiatus from music in 2010 and took over management of her career; her fourth album 4 (2011) was subsequently mellower in tone, exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul. Her critically acclaimed fifth album, Beyonc\u00e9 (2013), was distinguished from previous releases by its experimental production and exploration of darker themes.
