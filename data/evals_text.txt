Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
b''b'Geometrically an eigenvector, corresponding to a real nonzero eigenvalue, points in a direction that is stretched by the transformation and the eigenvalue is the factor by which it is stretched. If the eigenvalue is negative, the direction is reversed.[3]'b'There is a correspondence between n by n square matrices and linear transformations from an n-dimensional vector space to itself. For this reason, it is equivalent to define eigenvalues and eigenvectors using either the language of matrices or the language of linear transformations.[1][2]'b'If the vector space V is finite-dimensional, then the linear transformation T can be represented as a square matrix A, and the vector v by a column vector, rendering the above mapping as a matrix multiplication on the left hand side and a scaling of the column vector on the right hand side in the equation'b'where \xce\xbb is a scalar in the field F, known as the eigenvalue, characteristic value, or characteristic root associated with the eigenvector v.'b'In linear algebra, an eigenvector or characteristic vector of a linear transformation is a non-zero vector that only changes by a scalar factor when that linear transformation is applied to it. More formally, if T is a linear transformation from a vector space V over a field F into itself and v is a vector in V that is not the zero vector, then v is an eigenvector of T if T(v) is a scalar multiple of v. This condition can be written as the equation'
Square matrix
b''b'Square matrices are often used to represent simple linear transformations, such as shearing or rotation. For example, if R is a square matrix representing a rotation (rotation matrix) and v is a column vector describing the position of a point in space, the product Rv yields another column vector describing the position of that point after that rotation. If v is a row vector, the same transformation can be obtained using vRT, where RT is the transpose of R.'b'In mathematics, a square matrix is a matrix with the same number of rows and columns. An n-by-n matrix is known as a square matrix of order n. Any two square matrices of the same order can be added and multiplied.'
Row and column vectors
b''b'The column space can be viewed as the dual space to the row space, since any linear functional on the space of column vectors can be represented uniquely as an inner product with a specific row vector.'b'The set of all row vectors forms a vector space called row space, similarly the set of all column vectors forms a vector space called column space. The dimensions of the row and column spaces equals the number of entries in the row or column vector.'b'and the transpose of a column vector is a row vector'b'Throughout, boldface is used for the row and column vectors. The transpose (indicated by T) of a row vector is a column vector'b'Similarly, a row vector or row matrix is a 1 \xc3\x97 m matrix, that is, a matrix consisting of a single row of m elements[1]'b'In linear algebra, a column vector or column matrix is an m \xc3\x97 1 matrix, that is, a matrix consisting of a single column of m elements,'
Matrix multiplication
b''b'Computing matrix products is a central operation in all computational applications of linear algebra. Its computational complexity is \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          n\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(n^{3})}\n  \n (for n \xc3\x97 n matrices) for the basic algorithm (this complexity is \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          n\n          \n            2.373\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(n^{2.373})}\n  \n for the asymptotically fastest known algorithm). This nonlinear complexity means that matrix product is often the critical part of many algorithms. This is enforced by the fact that many operations on matrices, such as matrix inversion, determinant, solving systems of linear equations, have the same complexity. Therefore various algorithms have been devised for computing products of large matrices, taking into account the architecture of computers (see BLAS, for example).'b'A square matrix may have a multiplicative inverse, called an inverse matrix. In the common case where the entries belong to a commutative ring r, a matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant has a multiplicative inverse in r. The determinant of a product of square matrices is the product of the determinants of the factors. The n \xc3\x97 n matrices that have an inverse form a group under matrix multiplication, the subgroups of which are called matrix groups. Many classical groups (including all finite groups) are isomorphic to matrix groups; this is the starting point of the theory of group representations.'b'The definition of matrix product requires that the entries belong to a ring, which may be noncommutative, but is a field in most applications. Even in this latter case, matrix product is not commutative in general, although it is associative and is distributive over matrix addition. The identity matrices (which are the square matrices whose all entries are zero, except those of the main diagonal that are all equal to 1) are identity elements of the matrix product. It follows that the n \xc3\x97 n matrices over a ring form a ring, which is noncommutative except if n = 1 and the ground ring is commutative.'b'In mathematics, matrix multiplication or matrix product is a binary operation that produces a matrix from two matrices with entries in a field, or, more generally, in a ring. The matrix product is designed for representing the composition of linear maps that are represented by matrices. Matrix multiplication is thus a basic tool of linear algebra, and as such has numerous applications in many areas of mathematics, as well as in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering.[1][2] In more detail, if A is an n \xc3\x97 m matrix and B is an m \xc3\x97 p matrix, their matrix product AB is an n \xc3\x97 p matrix, in which the m entries across a row of A are multiplied with the m entries down a column of B and summed to produce an entry of AB. When two linear maps are represented by matrices, then the matrix product represents the composition of the two maps.'
Scalar (mathematics)
b''b'The term scalar matrix is used to denote a matrix of the form kI where k is a scalar and I is the identity matrix.'b'The term is also sometimes used informally to mean a vector, matrix, tensor, or other usually "compound" value that is actually reduced to a single component. Thus, for example, the product of a 1\xc3\x97n matrix and an n\xc3\x971 matrix, which is formally a 1\xc3\x971 matrix, is often said to be a scalar.'b'The real component of a quaternion is also called its scalar part.'b'A scalar product operation \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0not to be confused with scalar multiplication\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 may be defined on a vector space, allowing two vectors to be multiplied to produce a scalar. A vector space equipped with a scalar product is called an inner product space.'b'In linear algebra, real numbers or other elements of a field are called scalars and relate to vectors in a vector space through the operation of scalar multiplication, in which a vector can be multiplied by a number to produce another vector.[2][3][4] More generally, a vector space may be defined by using any field instead of real numbers, such as complex numbers. Then the scalars of that vector space will be the elements of the associated field.'b'A scalar is an element of a field which is used to define a vector space. A quantity described by multiple scalars, such as having both direction and magnitude, is called a vector.[1]'
Linear algebra
b''b'Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics. For instance, linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of geometry, including for defining basic objects such as lines, planes and rotations. Also, functional analysis may be basically viewed as the application of linear algebra to spaces of functions. Linear algebra is also used in most sciences and engineering areas, because it allows modeling many natural phenomena, and efficiently computing with such models. For nonlinear systems, which cannot be modeled with linear algebra, linear algebra is often used as a first approximation.'b'and their representations through matrices and vector spaces.[1][2][3]'b'linear functions such as'b'Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as'
Linear map
b''b'In the language of abstract algebra, a linear map is a module homomorphism. In the language of category theory it is a morphism in the category of modules over a given ring.'b'A linear map always maps linear subspaces onto linear subspaces (possibly of a lower dimension);[2] for instance it maps a plane through the origin to a plane, straight line or point. Linear maps can often be represented as matrices, and simple examples include rotation and reflection linear transformations.'b'An important special case is when V = W, in which case the map is called a linear operator,[1] or an endomorphism of\xc2\xa0V. Sometimes the term linear function has the same meaning as linear map, while in analytic geometry it does not.'b'In mathematics, a linear map (also called a linear mapping, linear transformation or, in some contexts, linear function) is a mapping V \xe2\x86\x92 W between two modules (including vector spaces) that preserves (in the sense defined below) the operations of addition and scalar multiplication.'
Vector space
b''b'Today, vector spaces are applied throughout mathematics, science and engineering. They are the appropriate linear-algebraic notion to deal with systems of linear equations. They offer a framework for Fourier expansion, which is employed in image compression routines, and they provide an environment that can be used for solution techniques for partial differential equations. Furthermore, vector spaces furnish an abstract, coordinate-free way of dealing with geometrical and physical objects such as tensors. This in turn allows the examination of local properties of manifolds by linearization techniques. Vector spaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in geometry and abstract algebra.'b"Historically, the first ideas leading to vector spaces can be traced back as far as the 17th century's analytic geometry, matrices, systems of linear equations, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by Giuseppe Peano in 1888, encompasses more general objects than Euclidean space, but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like lines, planes and their higher-dimensional analogs."b'Vector spaces are the subject of linear algebra and are well characterized by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in mathematical analysis, as function spaces, whose vectors are functions. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a topology, allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and continuity. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a norm or inner product are more commonly used, as having a notion of distance between two vectors. This is particularly the case of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.'b'Euclidean vectors are an example of a vector space. They represent physical quantities such as forces: any two forces (of the same type) can be added to yield a third, and the multiplication of a force vector by a real multiplier is another force vector. In the same vein, but in a more geometric sense, vectors representing displacements in the plane or in three-dimensional space also form vector spaces. Vectors in vector spaces do not necessarily have to be arrow-like objects as they appear in the mentioned examples: vectors are regarded as abstract mathematical objects with particular properties, which in some cases can be visualized as arrows.'b'A vector space (also called a linear space) is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers, called scalars. Scalars are often taken to be real numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms, listed below.'

Field (mathematics)
b''b'Fields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of analysis, which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.'b'The relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a field extension. Galois theory, initiated by \xc3\x89variste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and squaring the circle can not be done with a compass and straightedge. Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.'b'The best known fields are the field of rational numbers and the field of real numbers. The field of complex numbers is also widely used, not only in mathematics, but also in many areas of science and engineering. Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, algebraic function fields, algebraic number fields, and p-adic fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry. Most cryptographic protocols rely on finite fields, i.e., fields with finitely many elements.'b'In mathematics, a field is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined, and behave as when they are applied to rational and real numbers. A field is thus a fundamental algebraic structure, which is widely used in algebra, number theory and many other areas of mathematics.'

More generally, principal component analysis can be used as a method of factor analysis in structural equation modeling."b'The eigendecomposition of a symmetric positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix yields an orthogonal basis of eigenvectors, each of which has a nonnegative eigenvalue. The orthogonal decomposition of a PSD matrix is used in multivariate analysis, where the sample covariance matrices are PSD. This orthogonal decomposition is called principal components analysis (PCA) in statistics. PCA studies linear relations among variables. PCA is performed on the covariance matrix or the correlation matrix (in which each variable is scaled to have its sample variance equal to one). For the covariance or correlation matrix, the eigenvectors correspond to principal components and the eigenvalues to the variance explained by the principal components. Principal component analysis of the correlation matrix provides an orthonormal eigen-basis for the space of the observed data: In this basis, the largest eigenvalues correspond to the principal components that are associated with most of the covariability among a number of observed data.'b"The output for the orientation tensor is in the three orthogonal (perpendicular) axes of space.

The corresponding eigenvalues are interpreted as ionization potentials via Koopmans' theorem. In this case, the term eigenvector is used in a somewhat more general meaning, since the Fock operator is explicitly dependent on the orbitals and their eigenvalues. Thus, if one wants to underline this aspect, one speaks of nonlinear eigenvalue problems. Such equations are usually solved by an iteration procedure, called in this case self-consistent field method.

Let P be a non-singular square matrix such that P\xe2\x88\x921AP is some diagonal matrix D. Left multiplying both by P, AP = PD. Each column of P must therefore be an eigenvector of A whose eigenvalue is the corresponding diagonal element of D. Since the columns of P must be linearly independent for P to be invertible, there exist n linearly independent eigenvectors of A. It then follows that the eigenvectors of A form a basis if and only if A is diagonalizable.'b'A can therefore be decomposed into a matrix composed of its eigenvectors, a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues along the diagonal, and the inverse of the matrix of eigenvectors. This is called the eigendecomposition and it is a similarity transformation. Such a matrix A is said to be similar to the diagonal matrix \xce\x9b or diagonalizable.

Define a square matrix Q whose columns are the n linearly independent eigenvectors of A,'b'Comparing this equation to Equation (1), it follows immediately that a left eigenvector of A is the same as the transpose of a right eigenvector of AT, with the same eigenvalue. Furthermore, since the characteristic polynomial of AT is the same as the characteristic polynomial of A, the eigenvalues of the left eigenvectors of A are the same as the eigenvalues of the right eigenvectors of AT.'b'where \xce\xba is a scalar and u is a 1 by n matrix.

Taking the transpose of this equation,'b'The eigenvalue and eigenvector problem can also be defined for row vectors that left multiply matrix A. In this formulation, the defining equation is'b'Many disciplines traditionally represent vectors as matrices with a single column rather than as matrices with a single row. For that reason, the word "eigenvector" in the context of matrices almost always refers to a right eigenvector, namely a column vector that right multiples the n by n matrix A in the defining equation, Equation (1),'b"Let A be an arbitrary n by n matrix of complex numbers with eigenvalues \xce\xbb1, \xce\xbb2, ..., \xce\xbbn.

The resulting similar matrix B is block upper triangular, with its top left block being the diagonal matrix \xce\xbeI\xce\xb3A(\xce\xbe). As a result, the characteristic polynomial of B will have a factor of (\xce\xbe\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa0\xce\xbb)\xce\xb3A(\xce\xbe). The other factors of the characteristic polynomial of B are not known, so the algebraic multiplicity of \xce\xbe as an eigenvalue of B is no less than the geometric multiplicity of \xce\xbe as an eigenvalue of A. The last element of the proof is the property that similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial.'b"Because of the definition of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, an eigenvalue's geometric multiplicity must be at least one, that is, each eigenvalue has at least one associated eigenvector.

On the other hand, by definition, any non-zero vector that satisfies this condition is an eigenvector of A associated with \xce\xbb. So, the set E is the union of the zero vector with the set of all eigenvectors of A associated with \xce\xbb, and E equals the nullspace of (A \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbbI). E is called the eigenspace or characteristic space of A associated with \xce\xbb.[7][8] In general \xce\xbb is a complex number and the eigenvectors are complex n by 1 matrices.

Therefore, any real matrix with odd order has at least one real eigenvalue, whereas a real matrix with even order may not have any real eigenvalues. The eigenvectors associated with these complex eigenvalues are also complex and also appear in complex conjugate pairs.'b'If the entries of the matrix A are all real numbers, then the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial will also be real numbers, but the eigenvalues may still have non-zero imaginary parts.

Francis[20] and Vera Kublanovskaya[21] in 1961.[22]'b'At the start of the 20th century, Hilbert studied the eigenvalues of integral operators by viewing the operators as infinite matrices.[17] He was the first to use the German word eigen, which means "own", to denote eigenvalues and eigenvectors in 1904,[18] though he may have been following a related usage by Helmholtz. For some time, the standard term in English was "proper value", but the more distinctive term "eigenvalue" is standard today.[19]'b"In the meantime, Liouville studied eigenvalue problems similar to those of Sturm; the discipline that grew out of their work is now called Sturm\xe2\x80\x93Liouville theory.[15] Schwarz studied the first eigenvalue of Laplace's equation on general domains towards the end of the 19th century, while Poincar\xc3\xa9 studied Poisson's equation a few years later.[16]"b"Fourier used the work of Laplace and Lagrange to solve the heat equation by separation of variables in his famous 1822 book Th\xc3\xa9orie analytique de la chaleur.[14] Sturm developed Fourier's ideas further and brought them to the attention of Cauchy, who combined them with his own ideas and arrived at the fact that real symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues.[11] This was extended by Hermite in 1855 to what are now called Hermitian matrices.[12] Around the same time, Brioschi proved that the eigenvalues of orthogonal matrices lie on the unit circle,[11] and Clebsch found the corresponding result for skew-symmetric matrices.[12] Finally, Weierstrass clarified an important aspect in the stability theory started by Laplace by realizing that defective matrices can cause instability.[11]"b'In the 18th century Euler studied the rotational motion of a rigid body and discovered the importance of the principal axes.[9] Lagrange realized that the principal axes are the eigenvectors of the inertia matrix.[10] In the early 19th century, Cauchy saw how their work could be used to classify the quadric surfaces, and generalized it to arbitrary dimensions.[11] Cauchy also coined the term racine caract\xc3\xa9ristique (characteristic root) for what is now called eigenvalue; his term survives in characteristic equation.[12][13]'b'Eigenvalues are often introduced in the context of linear algebra or matrix theory. Historically, however, they arose in the study of quadratic forms and differential equations.'b'Eigenvalues and eigenvectors give rise to many closely related mathematical concepts, and the prefix eigen- is applied liberally when naming them:'b'where the eigenvector v is an n by 1 matrix. For a matrix, eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be used to decompose the matrix, for example by diagonalizing it.'b'Alternatively, the linear transformation could take the form of an n by n matrix, in which case the eigenvectors are n by 1 matrices that are also referred to as eigenvectors. If the linear transformation is expressed in the form of an n by n matrix A, then the eigenvalue equation above for a linear transformation can be rewritten as the matrix multiplication'b'Linear transformations can take many different forms, mapping vectors in a variety of vector spaces, so the eigenvectors can also take many forms. For example, the linear transformation could be a differential operator like \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              \n                d\n                x\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {d}{dx}}}\n  \n, in which case the eigenvectors are functions called eigenfunctions that are scaled by that differential operator, such as'b'The Mona Lisa example pictured at right provides a simple illustration. Each point on the painting can be represented as a vector pointing from the center of the painting to that point. The linear transformation in this example is called a shear mapping. Points in the top half are moved to the right and points in the bottom half are moved to the left proportional to how far they are from the horizontal axis that goes through the middle of the painting. The vectors pointing to each point in the original image are therefore tilted right or left and made longer or shorter by the transformation. Notice that points along the horizontal axis do not move at all when this transformation is applied. Therefore, any vector that points directly to the right or left with no vertical component is an eigenvector of this transformation because the mapping does not change its direction. Moreover, these eigenvectors all have an eigenvalue equal to one because the mapping does not change their length, either.'b'referred to as the eigenvalue equation or eigenequation. In general, \xce\xbb may be any scalar. For example, \xce\xbb may be negative, in which case the eigenvector reverses direction as part of the scaling, or it may be zero or complex.'b'In essence, an eigenvector v of a linear transformation T is a non-zero vector that, when T is applied to it, does not change direction. Applying T to the eigenvector only scales the eigenvector by the scalar value \xce\xbb, called an eigenvalue. This condition can be written as the equation'b'Eigenvalues and eigenvectors feature prominently in the analysis of linear transformations. The prefix eigen- is adopted from the German word eigen for "proper", "characteristic".[4] Originally utilized to study principal axes of the rotational motion of rigid bodies, eigenvalues and eigenvectors have a wide range of applications, for example in stability analysis, vibration analysis, atomic orbitals, facial recognition, and matrix diagonalization.'b''b''b'Geometrically an eigenvector, corresponding to a real nonzero eigenvalue, points in a direction that is stretched by the transformation and the eigenvalue is the factor by which it is stretched. If the eigenvalue is negative, the direction is reversed.[3]'b'There is a correspondence between n by n square matrices and linear transformations from an n-dimensional vector space to itself. For this reason, it is equivalent to define eigenvalues and eigenvectors using either the language of matrices or the language of linear transformations.[1][2]'b'If the vector space V is finite-dimensional, then the linear transformation T can be represented as a square matrix A, and the vector v by a column vector, rendering the above mapping as a matrix multiplication on the left hand side and a scaling of the column vector on the right hand side in the equation'b'where \xce\xbb is a scalar in the field F, known as the eigenvalue, characteristic value, or characteristic root associated with the eigenvector v.'b'In linear algebra, an eigenvector or characteristic vector of a linear transformation is a non-zero vector that only changes by a scalar factor when that linear transformation is applied to it. More formally, if T is a linear transformation from a vector space V over a field F into itself and v is a vector in V that is not the zero vector, then v is an eigenvector of T if T(v) is a scalar multiple of v. This condition can be written as the equation'Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

They are very useful for expressing any face image as a linear combination of some of them. In the facial recognition branch of biometrics, eigenfaces provide a means of applying data compression to faces for identification purposes.

In Q methodology, the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix determine the Q-methodologist's judgment of practical significance (which differs from the statistical significance of hypothesis testing; cf. criteria for determining the number of factors). More generally, principal component analysis can be used as a method of factor analysis in structural equation modeling."b'The eigendecomposition of a symmetric positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix yields an orthogonal basis of eigenvectors, each of which has a nonnegative eigenvalue. The orthogonal decomposition of a PSD matrix is used in multivariate analysis, where the sample covariance matrices are PSD. This orthogonal decomposition is called principal components analysis (PCA) in statistics. PCA studies linear relations among variables. PCA is performed on the covariance matrix or the correlation matrix (in which each variable is scaled to have its sample variance equal to one). For the covariance or correlation matrix, the eigenvectors correspond to principal components and the eigenvalues to the variance explained by the principal components. Principal component analysis of the correlation matrix provides an orthonormal eigen-basis for the space of the observed data: In this basis, the largest eigenvalues correspond to the principal components that are associated with most of the covariability among a number of observed data.'b"The output for the orientation tensor is in the three orthogonal (perpendicular) axes of space.

The corresponding eigenvalues are interpreted as ionization potentials via Koopmans' theorem. In this case, the term eigenvector is used in a somewhat more general meaning, since the Fock operator is explicitly dependent on the orbitals and their eigenvalues. Thus, if one wants to underline this aspect, one speaks of nonlinear eigenvalue problems.

For defective matrices, the notion of eigenvectors generalizes to generalized eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues generalizes to the Jordan normal form. Over an algebraically closed field, any matrix A has a Jordan normal form and therefore admits a basis of generalized eigenvectors and a decomposition into generalized eigenspaces.'b'Conversely, suppose a matrix A is diagonalizable. Let P be a non-singular square matrix such that P\xe2\x88\x921AP is some diagonal matrix D. Left multiplying both by P, AP = PD. Each column of P must therefore be an eigenvector of A whose eigenvalue is the corresponding diagonal element of D. Since the columns of P must be linearly independent for P to be invertible, there exist n linearly independent eigenvectors of A. It then follows that the eigenvectors of A form a basis if and only if A is diagonalizable.'b'A can therefore be decomposed into a matrix composed of its eigenvectors, a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues along the diagonal, and the inverse of the matrix of eigenvectors. This is called the eigendecomposition and it is a similarity transformation. Such a matrix A is said to be similar to the diagonal matrix \xce\x9b or diagonalizable. The matrix Q is the change of basis matrix of the similarity transformation. Essentially, the matrices A and \xce\x9b represent the same linear transformation expressed in two different bases. The eigenvectors are used as the basis when representing the linear transformation as\xc2\xa0\xce\x9b.'b'or by instead left multiplying both sides by Q\xe2\x88\x921,'b'Because the columns of Q are linearly independent, Q is invertible.

The eigenvalues need not be distinct. Define a square matrix Q whose columns are the n linearly independent eigenvectors of A,'b'Comparing this equation to Equation (1), it follows immediately that a left eigenvector of A is the same as the transpose of a right eigenvector of AT, with the same eigenvalue. Furthermore, since the characteristic polynomial of AT is the same as the characteristic polynomial of A, the eigenvalues of the left eigenvectors of A are the same as the eigenvalues of the right eigenvectors of AT.'b'where \xce\xba is a scalar and u is a 1 by n matrix. Any row vector u satisfying this equation is called a left eigenvector of A and \xce\xba is its associated eigenvalue. Taking the transpose of this equation,'b'The eigenvalue and eigenvector problem can also be defined for row vectors that left multiply matrix A. In this formulation, the defining equation is'b'Many disciplines traditionally represent vectors as matrices with a single column rather than as matrices with a single row. For that reason, the word "eigenvector" in the context of matrices almost always refers to a right eigenvector, namely a column vector that right multiples the n by n matrix A in the defining equation, Equation (1),'b"Let A be an arbitrary n by n matrix of complex numbers with eigenvalues \xce\xbb1, \xce\xbb2, ..., \xce\xbbn.

The resulting similar matrix B is block upper triangular, with its top left block being the diagonal matrix \xce\xbeI\xce\xb3A(\xce\xbe). As a result, the characteristic polynomial of B will have a factor of (\xce\xbe\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa0\xce\xbb)\xce\xb3A(\xce\xbe). The other factors of the characteristic polynomial of B are not known, so the algebraic multiplicity of \xce\xbe as an eigenvalue of B is no less than the geometric multiplicity of \xce\xbe as an eigenvalue of A. The last element of the proof is the property that similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial.'b"Because of the definition of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, an eigenvalue's geometric multiplicity must be at least one, that is, each eigenvalue has at least one associated eigenvector. Furthermore, an eigenvalue's geometric multiplicity cannot exceed its algebraic multiplicity. Additionally, recall that an eigenvalue's algebraic multiplicity cannot exceed n."b"The dimension of the eigenspace E associated with \xce\xbb, or equivalently the maximum number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with \xce\xbb, is referred to as the eigenvalue's geometric multiplicity \xce\xb3A(\xce\xbb).

That is, if two vectors u and v belong to the set E, written (u,v) \xe2\x88\x88 E, then (u + v) \xe2\x88\x88 E or equivalently A(u + v) = \xce\xbb(u + v). This can be checked using the distributive property of matrix multiplication. Similarly, because E is a linear subspace, it is closed under scalar multiplication. That is, if v \xe2\x88\x88 E and \xce\xb1 is a complex number, (\xce\xb1v) \xe2\x88\x88 E or equivalently A(\xce\xb1v) = \xce\xbb(\xce\xb1v). This can be checked by noting that multiplication of complex matrices by complex numbers is commutative. As long as u + v and \xce\xb1v are not zero, they are also eigenvectors of A associated with \xce\xbb.'b'On one hand, this set is precisely the kernel or nullspace of the matrix (A \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbbI). On the other hand, by definition, any non-zero vector that satisfies this condition is an eigenvector of A associated with \xce\xbb. So, the set E is the union of the zero vector with the set of all eigenvectors of A associated with \xce\xbb, and E equals the nullspace of (A \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbbI). E is called the eigenspace or characteristic space of A associated with \xce\xbb.[7][8] In general \xce\xbb is a complex number and the eigenvectors are complex n by 1 matrices. A property of the nullspace is that it is a linear subspace, so E is a linear subspace of \xe2\x84\x82n.'b'Given a particular eigenvalue \xce\xbb of the n by n matrix A, define the set E to be all vectors v that satisfy Equation (2),'b'If \xce\xbcA(\xce\xbbi) = 1, then \xce\xbbi is said to be a simple eigenvalue.[27] If \xce\xbcA(\xce\xbbi) equals the geometric multiplicity of \xce\xbbi, \xce\xb3A(\xce\xbbi), defined in the next section, then \xce\xbbi is said to be a semisimple eigenvalue.'b"If d = n then the right hand side is the product of n linear terms and this is the same as Equation (4). The size of each eigenvalue's algebraic multiplicity is related to the dimension n as"b'Suppose a matrix A has dimension n and d \xe2\x89\xa4 n distinct eigenvalues. Whereas Equation (4) factors the characteristic polynomial of A into the product of n linear terms with some terms potentially repeating, the characteristic polynomial can instead be written as the product of d terms each corresponding to a distinct eigenvalue and raised to the power of the algebraic multiplicity,'b'Let \xce\xbbi be an eigenvalue of an n by n matrix A. The algebraic multiplicity \xce\xbcA(\xce\xbbi) of the eigenvalue is its multiplicity as a root of the characteristic polynomial, that is, the largest integer k such that (\xce\xbb \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbbi)k divides evenly that polynomial.[8][26][27]'b'The non-real roots of a real polynomial with real coefficients can be grouped into pairs of complex conjugates, namely with the two members of each pair having imaginary parts that differ only in sign and the same real part. If the degree is odd, then by the intermediate value theorem at least one of the roots is real. Therefore, any real matrix with odd order has at least one real eigenvalue, whereas a real matrix with even order may not have any real eigenvalues. The eigenvectors associated with these complex eigenvalues are also complex and also appear in complex conjugate pairs.'b'If the entries of the matrix A are all real numbers, then the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial will also be real numbers, but the eigenvalues may still have non-zero imaginary parts. The entries of the corresponding eigenvectors therefore may also have non-zero imaginary parts. Similarly, the eigenvalues may be irrational numbers even if all the entries of A are rational numbers or even if they are all integers.

For some time, the standard term in English was "proper value", but the more distinctive term "eigenvalue" is standard today.[19]'b"In the meantime, Liouville studied eigenvalue problems similar to those of Sturm; the discipline that grew out of their work is now called Sturm\xe2\x80\x93Liouville theory.[15] Schwarz studied the first eigenvalue of Laplace's equation on general domains towards the end of the 19th century, while Poincar\xc3\xa9 studied Poisson's equation a few years later.[16]"b"Fourier used the work of Laplace and Lagrange to solve the heat equation by separation of variables in his famous 1822 book Th\xc3\xa9orie analytique de la chaleur.[14] Sturm developed Fourier's ideas further and brought them to the attention of Cauchy, who combined them with his own ideas and arrived at the fact that real symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues.[11] This was extended by Hermite in 1855 to what are now called Hermitian matrices.[12] Around the same time, Brioschi proved that the eigenvalues of orthogonal matrices lie on the unit circle,[11] and Clebsch found the corresponding result for skew-symmetric matrices.[12] Finally, Weierstrass clarified an important aspect in the stability theory started by Laplace by realizing that defective matrices can cause instability.[11]"b'In the 18th century Euler studied the rotational motion of a rigid body and discovered the importance of the principal axes.[9] Lagrange realized that the principal axes are the eigenvectors of the inertia matrix.[10] In the early 19th century, Cauchy saw how their work could be used to classify the quadric surfaces, and generalized it to arbitrary dimensions.[11] Cauchy also coined the term racine caract\xc3\xa9ristique (characteristic root) for what is now called eigenvalue; his term survives in characteristic equation.[12][13]'b'Eigenvalues are often introduced in the context of linear algebra or matrix theory.

For a matrix, eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be used to decompose the matrix, for example by diagonalizing it.'b'Alternatively, the linear transformation could take the form of an n by n matrix, in which case the eigenvectors are n by 1 matrices that are also referred to as eigenvectors. If the linear transformation is expressed in the form of an n by n matrix A, then the eigenvalue equation above for a linear transformation can be rewritten as the matrix multiplication'b'Linear transformations can take many different forms, mapping vectors in a variety of vector spaces, so the eigenvectors can also take many forms.

Each point on the painting can be represented as a vector pointing from the center of the painting to that point. The linear transformation in this example is called a shear mapping. Points in the top half are moved to the right and points in the bottom half are moved to the left proportional to how far they are from the horizontal axis that goes through the middle of the painting. The vectors pointing to each point in the original image are therefore tilted right or left and made longer or shorter by the transformation. Notice that points along the horizontal axis do not move at all when this transformation is applied. Therefore, any vector that points directly to the right or left with no vertical component is an eigenvector of this transformation because the mapping does not change its direction. Moreover, these eigenvectors all have an eigenvalue equal to one because the mapping does not change their length, either.'b'referred to as the eigenvalue equation or eigenequation.

An example is Google's PageRank algorithm. The principal eigenvector of a modified adjacency matrix of the World Wide Web graph gives the page ranks as its components. This vector corresponds to the stationary distribution of the Markov chain represented by the row-normalized adjacency matrix; however, the adjacency matrix must first be modified to ensure a stationary distribution exists. The second smallest eigenvector can be used to partition the graph into clusters, via spectral clustering.

Because it is diagonal, in this orientation, the stress tensor has no shear components; the components it does have are the principal components.'b'In mechanics, the eigenvectors of the moment of inertia tensor define the principal axes of a rigid body. The tensor of moment of inertia is a key quantity required to determine the rotation of a rigid body around its center of mass.'b'Similar to this concept, eigenvoices represent the general direction of variability in human pronunciations of a particular utterance, such as a word in a language. Based on a linear combination of such eigenvoices, a new voice pronunciation of the word can be constructed. These concepts have been found useful in automatic speech recognition systems for speaker adaptation.'b'In image processing, processed images of faces can be seen as vectors whose components are the brightnesses of each pixel.[45] The dimension of this vector space is the number of pixels. The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix associated with a large set of normalized pictures of faces are called eigenfaces; this is an example of principal component analysis. They are very useful for expressing any face image as a linear combination of some of them. In the facial recognition branch of biometrics, eigenfaces provide a means of applying data compression to faces for identification purposes. Research related to eigen vision systems determining hand gestures has also been made.'b'The orthogonality properties of the eigenvectors allows decoupling of the differential equations so that the system can be represented as linear summation of the eigenvectors. The eigenvalue problem of complex structures is often solved using finite element analysis, but neatly generalize the solution to scalar-valued vibration problems.'b'This can be reduced to a generalized eigenvalue problem by algebraic manipulation at the cost of solving a larger system.'b'leads to a so-called quadratic eigenvalue problem,'b'where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \xcf\x89\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\omega ^{2}}\n  \n is the eigenvalue and \n  \n    \n      \n        \xcf\x89\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\omega }\n  \n is the (imaginary) angular frequency.

In particular, undamped vibration is governed by'b"Principal component analysis is used to study large data sets, such as those encountered in bioinformatics, data mining, chemical research, psychology, and in marketing. PCA is popular especially in psychology, in the field of psychometrics. In Q methodology, the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix determine the Q-methodologist's judgment of practical significance (which differs from the statistical significance of hypothesis testing; cf. criteria for determining the number of factors). More generally, principal component analysis can be used as a method of factor analysis in structural equation modeling."b'The eigendecomposition of a symmetric positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix yields an orthogonal basis of eigenvectors, each of which has a nonnegative eigenvalue. The orthogonal decomposition of a PSD matrix is used in multivariate analysis, where the sample covariance matrices are PSD. This orthogonal decomposition is called principal components analysis (PCA) in statistics. PCA studies linear relations among variables. PCA is performed on the covariance matrix or the correlation matrix (in which each variable is scaled to have its sample variance equal to one). For the covariance or correlation matrix, the eigenvectors correspond to principal components and the eigenvalues to the variance explained by the principal components. Principal component analysis of the correlation matrix provides an orthonormal eigen-basis for the space of the observed data: In this basis, the largest eigenvalues correspond to the principal components that are associated with most of the covariability among a number of observed data.'b"The output for the orientation tensor is in the three orthogonal (perpendicular) axes of space.

The corresponding eigenvalues are interpreted as ionization potentials via Koopmans' theorem. In this case, the term eigenvector is used in a somewhat more general meaning, since the Fock operator is explicitly dependent on the orbitals and their eigenvalues. Thus, if one wants to underline this aspect, one speaks of nonlinear eigenvalue problems. Such equations are usually solved by an iteration procedure, called in this case self-consistent field method.

The converse is true for finite-dimensional vector spaces, but not for infinite-dimensional vector spaces. In general, the operator (T \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbbI) may not have an inverse even if \xce\xbb is not an eigenvalue.'b'Consider again the eigenvalue equation, Equation (5). Define an eigenvalue to be any scalar \xce\xbb \xe2\x88\x88 K such that there exists a non-zero vector v \xe2\x88\x88 V satisfying Equation (5). It is important that this version of the definition of an eigenvalue specify that the vector be non-zero, otherwise by this definition the zero vector would allow any scalar in K to be an eigenvalue. Define an eigenvector v associated with the eigenvalue \xce\xbb to be any vector that, given \xce\xbb, satisfies Equation (5). Given the eigenvalue, the zero vector is among the vectors that satisfy Equation (5), so the zero vector is included among the eigenvectors by this alternate definition.'b'While the definition of an eigenvector used in this article excludes the zero vector, it is possible to define eigenvalues and eigenvectors such that the zero vector is an eigenvector.[38]'b'Any subspace spanned by eigenvectors of T is an invariant subspace of T, and the restriction of T to such a subspace is diagonalizable. Moreover, if the entire vector space V can be spanned by the eigenvectors of T, or equivalently if the direct sum of the eigenspaces associated with all the eigenvalues of T is the entire vector space V, then a basis of V called an eigenbasis can be formed from linearly independent eigenvectors of T. When T admits an eigenbasis, T is diagonalizable.'b'The eigenspaces of T always form a direct sum. As a consequence, eigenvectors of different eigenvalues are always linearly independent. Therefore, the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces cannot exceed the dimension n of the vector space on which T operates, and there cannot be more than n distinct eigenvalues.[37]'b'The geometric multiplicity \xce\xb3T(\xce\xbb) of an eigenvalue \xce\xbb is the dimension of the eigenspace associated with \xce\xbb, i.e., the maximum number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue.[8][27] By the definition of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, \xce\xb3T(\xce\xbb) \xe2\x89\xa5 1 because every eigenvalue has at least one eigenvector.'b'So, both u + v and \xce\xb1v are either zero or eigenvectors of T associated with \xce\xbb, namely (u+v,\xce\xb1v) \xe2\x88\x88 E, and E is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

For defective matrices, the notion of eigenvectors generalizes to generalized eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues generalizes to the Jordan normal form. Over an algebraically closed field, any matrix A has a Jordan normal form and therefore admits a basis of generalized eigenvectors and a decomposition into generalized eigenspaces.'b'Conversely, suppose a matrix A is diagonalizable. Let P be a non-singular square matrix such that P\xe2\x88\x921AP is some diagonal matrix D. Left multiplying both by P, AP = PD. Each column of P must therefore be an eigenvector of A whose eigenvalue is the corresponding diagonal element of D. Since the columns of P must be linearly independent for P to be invertible, there exist n linearly independent eigenvectors of A. It then follows that the eigenvectors of A form a basis if and only if A is diagonalizable.'b'A can therefore be decomposed into a matrix composed of its eigenvectors, a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues along the diagonal, and the inverse of the matrix of eigenvectors. This is called the eigendecomposition and it is a similarity transformation. Such a matrix A is said to be similar to the diagonal matrix \xce\x9b or diagonalizable. The matrix Q is the change of basis matrix of the similarity transformation. Essentially, the matrices A and \xce\x9b represent the same linear transformation expressed in two different bases. The eigenvectors are used as the basis when representing the linear transformation as\xc2\xa0\xce\x9b.'b'or by instead left multiplying both sides by Q\xe2\x88\x921,'b'Because the columns of Q are linearly independent, Q is invertible.

The eigenvalues need not be distinct. Define a square matrix Q whose columns are the n linearly independent eigenvectors of A,'b'Comparing this equation to Equation (1), it follows immediately that a left eigenvector of A is the same as the transpose of a right eigenvector of AT, with the same eigenvalue. Furthermore, since the characteristic polynomial of AT is the same as the characteristic polynomial of A, the eigenvalues of the left eigenvectors of A are the same as the eigenvalues of the right eigenvectors of AT.'b'where \xce\xba is a scalar and u is a 1 by n matrix. Any row vector u satisfying this equation is called a left eigenvector of A and \xce\xba is its associated eigenvalue. Taking the transpose of this equation,'b'The eigenvalue and eigenvector problem can also be defined for row vectors that left multiply matrix A. In this formulation, the defining equation is'b'Many disciplines traditionally represent vectors as matrices with a single column rather than as matrices with a single row. For that reason, the word "eigenvector" in the context of matrices almost always refers to a right eigenvector, namely a column vector that right multiples the n by n matrix A in the defining equation, Equation (1),'b"Let A be an arbitrary n by n matrix of complex numbers with eigenvalues \xce\xbb1, \xce\xbb2, ..., \xce\xbbn. Each eigenvalue appears \xce\xbcA(\xce\xbbi) times in this list, where \xce\xbcA(\xce\xbbi) is the eigenvalue's algebraic multiplicity.

The resulting similar matrix B is block upper triangular, with its top left block being the diagonal matrix \xce\xbeI\xce\xb3A(\xce\xbe). As a result, the characteristic polynomial of B will have a factor of (\xce\xbe\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa0\xce\xbb)\xce\xb3A(\xce\xbe). The other factors of the characteristic polynomial of B are not known, so the algebraic multiplicity of \xce\xbe as an eigenvalue of B is no less than the geometric multiplicity of \xce\xbe as an eigenvalue of A. The last element of the proof is the property that similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial.'b"Because of the definition of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, an eigenvalue's geometric multiplicity must be at least one, that is, each eigenvalue has at least one associated eigenvector. Furthermore, an eigenvalue's geometric multiplicity cannot exceed its algebraic multiplicity. Additionally, recall that an eigenvalue's algebraic multiplicity cannot exceed n."b"The dimension of the eigenspace E associated with \xce\xbb, or equivalently the maximum number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with \xce\xbb, is referred to as the eigenvalue's geometric multiplicity \xce\xb3A(\xce\xbb). Because E is also the nullspace of (A \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbbI), the geometric multiplicity of \xce\xbb is the dimension of the nullspace of (A \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbbI), also called the nullity of (A \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbbI), which relates to the dimension and rank of (A \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbbI) as"b'Because the eigenspace E is a linear subspace, it is closed under addition. That is, if two vectors u and v belong to the set E, written (u,v) \xe2\x88\x88 E, then (u + v) \xe2\x88\x88 E or equivalently A(u + v) = \xce\xbb(u + v). This can be checked using the distributive property of matrix multiplication. Similarly, because E is a linear subspace, it is closed under scalar multiplication. That is, if v \xe2\x88\x88 E and \xce\xb1 is a complex number, (\xce\xb1v) \xe2\x88\x88 E or equivalently A(\xce\xb1v) = \xce\xbb(\xce\xb1v). This can be checked by noting that multiplication of complex matrices by complex numbers is commutative. As long as u + v and \xce\xb1v are not zero, they are also eigenvectors of A associated with \xce\xbb.'b'On one hand, this set is precisely the kernel or nullspace of the matrix (A \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbbI). On the other hand, by definition, any non-zero vector that satisfies this condition is an eigenvector of A associated with \xce\xbb. So, the set E is the union of the zero vector with the set of all eigenvectors of A associated with \xce\xbb, and E equals the nullspace of (A \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbbI). E is called the eigenspace or characteristic space of A associated with \xce\xbb.[7][8] In general \xce\xbb is a complex number and the eigenvectors are complex n by 1 matrices. A property of the nullspace is that it is a linear subspace, so E is a linear subspace of \xe2\x84\x82n.'b'Given a particular eigenvalue \xce\xbb of the n by n matrix A, define the set E to be all vectors v that satisfy Equation (2),'b'If \xce\xbcA(\xce\xbbi) = 1, then \xce\xbbi is said to be a simple eigenvalue.[27] If \xce\xbcA(\xce\xbbi) equals the geometric multiplicity of \xce\xbbi, \xce\xb3A(\xce\xbbi), defined in the next section, then \xce\xbbi is said to be a semisimple eigenvalue.'b"If d = n then the right hand side is the product of n linear terms and this is the same as Equation (4). The size of each eigenvalue's algebraic multiplicity is related to the dimension n as"b'Suppose a matrix A has dimension n and d \xe2\x89\xa4 n distinct eigenvalues. Whereas Equation (4) factors the characteristic polynomial of A into the product of n linear terms with some terms potentially repeating, the characteristic polynomial can instead be written as the product of d terms each corresponding to a distinct eigenvalue and raised to the power of the algebraic multiplicity,'b'Let \xce\xbbi be an eigenvalue of an n by n matrix A. The algebraic multiplicity \xce\xbcA(\xce\xbbi) of the eigenvalue is its multiplicity as a root of the characteristic polynomial, that is, the largest integer k such that (\xce\xbb \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbbi)k divides evenly that polynomial.[8][26][27]'b'The non-real roots of a real polynomial with real coefficients can be grouped into pairs of complex conjugates, namely with the two members of each pair having imaginary parts that differ only in sign and the same real part. If the degree is odd, then by the intermediate value theorem at least one of the roots is real. Therefore, any real matrix with odd order has at least one real eigenvalue, whereas a real matrix with even order may not have any real eigenvalues. The eigenvectors associated with these complex eigenvalues are also complex and also appear in complex conjugate pairs.'b'If the entries of the matrix A are all real numbers, then the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial will also be real numbers, but the eigenvalues may still have non-zero imaginary parts. The entries of the corresponding eigenvectors therefore may also have non-zero imaginary parts. Similarly, the eigenvalues may be irrational numbers even if all the entries of A are rational numbers or even if they are all integers. However, if the entries of A are all algebraic numbers, which include the rationals, the eigenvalues are complex algebraic numbers.'b'Setting the characteristic polynomial equal to zero, it has roots at \xce\xbb = 1 and \xce\xbb = 3, which are the two eigenvalues of M.

One of the most popular methods today, the QR algorithm, was proposed independently by John G.F. Francis[20] and Vera Kublanovskaya[21] in 1961.[22]'b'At the start of the 20th century, Hilbert studied the eigenvalues of integral operators by viewing the operators as infinite matrices.[17] He was the first to use the German word eigen, which means "own", to denote eigenvalues and eigenvectors in 1904,[18] though he may have been following a related usage by Helmholtz. For some time, the standard term in English was "proper value", but the more distinctive term "eigenvalue" is standard today.[19]'b"In the meantime, Liouville studied eigenvalue problems similar to those of Sturm; the discipline that grew out of their work is now called Sturm\xe2\x80\x93Liouville theory.[15] Schwarz studied the first eigenvalue of Laplace's equation on general domains towards the end of the 19th century, while Poincar\xc3\xa9 studied Poisson's equation a few years later.[16]"b"Fourier used the work of Laplace and Lagrange to solve the heat equation by separation of variables in his famous 1822 book Th\xc3\xa9orie analytique de la chaleur.[14] Sturm developed Fourier's ideas further and brought them to the attention of Cauchy, who combined them with his own ideas and arrived at the fact that real symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues.[11] This was extended by Hermite in 1855 to what are now called Hermitian matrices.[12] Around the same time, Brioschi proved that the eigenvalues of orthogonal matrices lie on the unit circle,[11] and Clebsch found the corresponding result for skew-symmetric matrices.[12] Finally, Weierstrass clarified an important aspect in the stability theory started by Laplace by realizing that defective matrices can cause instability.[11]"b'In the 18th century Euler studied the rotational motion of a rigid body and discovered the importance of the principal axes.[9] Lagrange realized that the principal axes are the eigenvectors of the inertia matrix.[10] In the early 19th century, Cauchy saw how their work could be used to classify the quadric surfaces, and generalized it to arbitrary dimensions.[11] Cauchy also coined the term racine caract\xc3\xa9ristique (characteristic root) for what is now called eigenvalue; his term survives in characteristic equation.[12][13]'b'Eigenvalues are often introduced in the context of linear algebra or matrix theory. Historically, however, they arose in the study of quadratic forms and differential equations.'b'Eigenvalues and eigenvectors give rise to many closely related mathematical concepts, and the prefix eigen- is applied liberally when naming them:'b'where the eigenvector v is an n by 1 matrix. For a matrix, eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be used to decompose the matrix, for example by diagonalizing it.'b'Alternatively, the linear transformation could take the form of an n by n matrix, in which case the eigenvectors are n by 1 matrices that are also referred to as eigenvectors. If the linear transformation is expressed in the form of an n by n matrix A, then the eigenvalue equation above for a linear transformation can be rewritten as the matrix multiplication'b'Linear transformations can take many different forms, mapping vectors in a variety of vector spaces, so the eigenvectors can also take many forms. For example, the linear transformation could be a differential operator like \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              \n                d\n                x\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {d}{dx}}}\n  \n, in which case the eigenvectors are functions called eigenfunctions that are scaled by that differential operator, such as'b'The Mona Lisa example pictured at right provides a simple illustration. Each point on the painting can be represented as a vector pointing from the center of the painting to that point. The linear transformation in this example is called a shear mapping. Points in the top half are moved to the right and points in the bottom half are moved to the left proportional to how far they are from the horizontal axis that goes through the middle of the painting. The vectors pointing to each point in the original image are therefore tilted right or left and made longer or shorter by the transformation. Notice that points along the horizontal axis do not move at all when this transformation is applied. Therefore, any vector that points directly to the right or left with no vertical component is an eigenvector of this transformation because the mapping does not change its direction. Moreover, these eigenvectors all have an eigenvalue equal to one because the mapping does not change their length, either.'b'referred to as the eigenvalue equation or eigenequation. In general, \xce\xbb may be any scalar. For example, \xce\xbb may be negative, in which case the eigenvector reverses direction as part of the scaling, or it may be zero or complex.'b'In essence, an eigenvector v of a linear transformation T is a non-zero vector that, when T is applied to it, does not change direction.

The prefix eigen- is adopted from the German word eigen for "proper", "characteristic".[4] Originally utilized to study principal axes of the rotational motion of rigid bodies, eigenvalues and eigenvectors have a wide range of applications, for example in stability analysis, vibration analysis, atomic orbitals, facial recognition, and matrix diagonalization.'b''b''b'Geometrically an eigenvector, corresponding to a real nonzero eigenvalue, points in a direction that is stretched by the transformation and the eigenvalue is the factor by which it is stretched.
