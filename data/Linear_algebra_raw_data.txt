Cauchy–Schwarz inequality
In mathematics, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, also known as the Cauchy–Bunyakovsky–Schwarz inequality, is a useful inequality encountered in many different settings, such as linear algebra, analysis, probability theory, vector algebra and other areas. It is considered to be one of the most important inequalities in all of mathematics.[1]The inequality for sums was published by Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1821), while the corresponding inequality for integrals was first proved byViktor Bunyakovsky (1859). The modern proof of the integral inequality was given by Hermann Amandus Schwarz (1888).[1]or LetThen, by linearity of the inner product in its first argument, one haswhich givesThis establishes the theorem.Titu's lemma (named after Titu Andreescu, also known as T2 Lemma, Engel's form, or Sedrakyan's inequality) states that for positive reals, we havewhich yields the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.For the inner product space of square-integrable complex-valued functions, one hasA generalization of this is the Hölder inequality.The triangle inequality for the standard norm is often shown as a consequence of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, as follows: given vectors x and y:Taking square roots gives the triangle inequality.The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality is used to prove that the inner product is a continuous function with respect to the topology induced by the inner product itself.[8][9]The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality allows one to extend the notion of "angle between two vectors" to any real inner-product space by defining:[10][11]The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality proves that this definition is sensible, by showing that the right-hand side lies in the interval [−1, 1] and justifies the notion that (real) Hilbert spaces are simply generalizations of the Euclidean space. It can also be used to define an angle in complex inner-product spaces, by taking the absolute value or the real part of the right-hand side,[12][13] as is done when extracting a metric from quantum fidelity.Let X, Y be random variables, then the covariance inequality[14][15] is given byAfter defining an inner product on the set of random variables using the expectation of their product,then the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality becomesVarious generalizations of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality exist in the context of operator theory, e.g. for operator-convex functions and operator algebras, where the domain and/or range are replaced by a C*-algebra or W*-algebra.which extends verbatim to positive functionals on C*-algebras:The next two theorems are further examples in operator algebra.Another generalization is a refinement obtained by interpolating between both sides the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:  It can be easily proven by Hölder's inequality.[23] There are also non commutative versions for operators and tensor products of matrices.[24]
